# Project Title 
# Atomistic Monte Carlo Simulation & Structual Analysis via Radial Distribution Function (RDF)

# Motivation
# Course project in ChE696: Simulation of Condensed Matter System

# Content
# Monte_Carlo-Inline.cpp simulates particles in an orthogonal box using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and widom insertion to calculating system thermodynamic properties. 
# RDF_Obj_Oriented.cpp calculates the RDF of a system once given the particle trajectory.

# Credit
# The skeleton of the code was provided by the instructor Dr. Rebecca Lindsey.
